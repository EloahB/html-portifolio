<h1>The Best Movies According to Eloah</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Your name</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime movie. I love how it breaks the frames of your tipical romantic movie and make it a loving experience</p>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>This is one is only for the crazy minds I think. Again another move that breaks the mold of how a movie should be and even between all the crazyness it makes you feel so much.</p>

<h3>How to train your dragon</h3>
<p>This one is so heart warming, at the same time funny and it even teaches you a lesson or two.</p>
